# UnityRune v0.0!

Welcome to UnityRune! A deltarune engine clone made in Unity!
I started this project in January 2019, and I've been working on it on my free time (because school, y'know.)

# Goals

The goal of this project is to have a fully working scriptable Deltarune engine inside Unity to be able to make fan-games, custom stories, or anything you want!
That includes :
- Scriptable stories
- Tilemapping worlds/rooms
- Controllable characters from DR/UT
- Textboxes
- Battle system
- Menu, inventory, stats..
- Sound engine

# What can I do with it right now ?

Right now, the engine is very primitive. You can move around (with Ralsei, for now), create tilemapped worlds, textboxes and cutscenes.
(project's progress is relatively slow because of the time i'm investing in it, as well as my literal incompetence with Unity, lol)

# Can I watch the project's progress ?

Sure ! I've made a [GloBoard](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/XEY6RDlDSQAP5r-o) to reference the current progress, as well as upcoming features, what I'm working on and bugs.
Apart from that, updates will always be pushed here when they're done.
