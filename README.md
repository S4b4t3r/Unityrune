# UnityRune vIndev ! (development branch) 

This is the development branch, updated daily with new content (except it might be broken, most of the time.)
Download at your own risks! (Except it's not risky at all. It might just not work.)

# Features

- A main menu (Woaaaah! Incredible!)
- A very primitive world to test collisions
- Music
- One character is playable (Ralsei), walking is fully animated and he has a collider.
- Textboxes can display text, images, and speak (although the latter is still WIP)

# What to expect in future releases

- Many more!
